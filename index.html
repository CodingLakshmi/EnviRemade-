	<p id="pTag"> EnviRemade is a social enterprise focused on collecting and processing recycling for reusable products. We
		understand the importance of sustainability and work towards achieving it. In our shifting world, issues like climate change
		and pollution have only become more salient; however, with us, we could change that. Working with small businesses, sharing
		our goal, we will educate the public about the benefits of sustainability.
	</p>
	<p id="pTag"> Rather than just diverting items that would end up in a landfill, we also work to reuse items that are already
		in the landfills. With your help, we can reduce 60% of the worldâ€™s landfills. By doing this, you can reduce pollution and
		stem carbon emissions. This is your planet. This is our planet. Together, EnviRemade can protect it.

<ul>
    Our mission focuses on three core principles: 
    <li> To provide communities an opporunity to change their waste into a beneficial resource. </li>
    <li> To contribute to the lessening of resource wasteage. </li>
    <li> To allow consumers to buy sustainably recycled materials. </li>
      </ul>
