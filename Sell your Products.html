    <p id="pTag"> EnviRemade helps businesses become more sustainable, but why is it important to be sustainable? Well, it’s not just to be nice. According to Harvard Business Review, 72% of businesses report that their supply chains could be affected by climate change or pollution. Not to mention, consumers care. News coverage on a company’s social responsibility affects consumer behavior; customers are willing to pay a 20% premium for sustainability. So, it pays to be sustainable </p>
    </br>
    <p id = "pTag"> By selling to EnviRemade, you are not only helping mitigate the detrimental impacts of waste on the environment, but you are also able to make money. 
      Each kilogram of items, may it be plastic, aluminium or tin will reimburse you $4. By reusing your trash, not only are you able to reuse resources, but you are also able to make money.
      
      In order to sell your times,  we will send you an 'Envri'- a box that has been preweighed, and you will fill it up with your content. In this box will be included a postage sticker which will allow you to send your waste items to our center. After our employees weigh your items, an automatic reciept will be sent to you as well as your reimbursement. 
      
      Corporations or small businesses who would like to sell their waste are also able to book our corporate package which consits of EnviRemade collecting all of the waste materials from a specified location.   </p>
    </br>
    <ul>
      Criteria:

    </ul>

    <p id="pTag"> The process to convert them is simple. First, any wrappers are discarded. The items are then sorted into material types, and further into colors. After, items are then broken down into pellets. Don’t be alarmed, the typical heat and pressure isn’t used to break the material down.We don’t use petroleum as our petrochemicals-or fuel, but the waste plastic.  </p>
    <p id="pTag"> For example in the case of plastics, a catalyst is used to break down the plastic in a reactor. The catalyst breaks the bonds between the chemicals DMT and MEG and is then transformed into PET, polyethylene terephthalate—the base material for many plastic products. These are then melted down into sheets, compressed, and are ready to be sold. </p>
